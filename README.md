# Personal Portfolio – Trevyn Sanders

This is my personal portfolio site where I showcase the projects I’ve built while learning web development.

It’s a static site built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a small amount of **JavaScript** for smooth scrolling, active nav highlighting, and project card animations.
